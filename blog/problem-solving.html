      <h3>locked myself out of my flat:</h3>
      <p>
        This is an issue that most of us have encountered.. and it is like any
        problem with variables and may have several possible functions to return
        a solutions. It starts with confusion..maybe shaking something.. talking
        to yourself, or a rubber duck (which you may try to use as a key at some
        point).
        <br />
        After lots of time we came up with an option:
        <br />
        <pre>function getKeyAction(key) { 
          const keys = { 
            "break door": "Wrong answer", 
            "call mum": "Wrong answer", 
            "throw rocks at flatmates window": "Wrong answer", 
            "sleep on porch like a cat": "Wrong answer", 
            "climb into second floor window": "Yup! Don't forget your key dummy!" 
            }; 
            return keys[key] || "Wrong answer"; 
          } 
          Example usage:
          console.log(getKeyAction("break door")); // Output: Wrong answer
          console.log(getKeyAction("climb into second floor window")); // Output:
          Yup! Don't forget your key dummy!
        </pre>

      <h3>elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      <p>Most of the people who know me wouldn't consider me an elegant problem-solver
          by default.
          I have de-escalated a situation on a hike over the Tongariro crossing. One of 
          friend-of-a-friend hadn't hiked before and struggled through the first 30 minutes
          into the track. The other people was getting annoyed and tensions (and safety)
          were starting to be of concern. 
          I suggested that the others carry on with the climb, and I stayed with this person
          while she rested. It wasn't an issue for me and I could tell that she was a 
          little disappointed in herself, and we couldn't safely finish the tramp. 
          I think where this became an elegant solution was where I suggested we take our
          time and walk to the base of the mountain, and for her to walk maybe a few meters
          onto the mountain. A 1 hour trip took 4, but we learned lots about each other, and 
          had an opportunity to appreciate and discuss the flora in the area. She also had
          lots of pics

      <h3>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of the problem-solving
        techniques/processes throughout the sprints:
      </h3>
      <p>The most challenging one has been Googling as there is always too 
          much information out there, which is challenging for newbies like myself. 
          The other methods are starting to work out and I have a list that I created
          and follow should an issue arise. Pseudocode is the newest and the least
          confident I am at.

      <h3>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h3>
      <p>When I was a student in high school, there were expectations from teachers,
          and the school, to represent 'us' at academic competitions. I intepreted 
          this as, "don't ask questions, because we expect you to know this". 
          <br>
          This likely wasn't the complete story, but I did hit the wall and almost
          failed one of the years. The funny thing was that teachers and my folks
          were not aware I struggled with it. 
          <br>
          What I have changed over time are the way I think, and what I want to do 
          with my time:
          <ul>
            <li>We can't be smart at everything, and you can always learn from 
                others if you ask questions. 
            </li>
            <li>It is more fun to learn something by choice, instead of wasting your
                time on something you have to learn.
            </li>
          </ul>
