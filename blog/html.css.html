    <p>
      First thing you need to know is the size of your place. This is what we
      would call the <strong>margins</strong>, or total area you can work with.
      You probably want to know if you can even get your chair into your place.
      In a website, this is your area to play and helps you decide the layout
      and rooms you want
    </p>

    <div>
      <img
        src="/home/ravidass/devacademy/ravidassnz.github.io/images/chair.jpg"
        alt="chair"
      /><!--placeholder and be more creative here. also find out whyit isn't loading onto site-->
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Finally you want to move the furniture around inside the room like a
      jigsaw puzzle so everything fits. This would be called the
      <strong>padding</strong> and in a website, you can play within the border
      and add or move multiple bits like images, texts and lots of other fun
      things.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div>
      <img
        src="https://github.com/Ravidassnz/ravidassnz.github.io/blob/main/images/chair.jpg"
        alt="chair"
      /><!--placeholder and be more creative here-->
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Next you need to understand the space you are working with. No point
      buying a large bed that won't fit inside the bedroom. This is the
      <strong>border</strong> of your room, or a specific section within the
      website that you are working inside. A large image won't work in a small
      and will look odd. Same thing as a bed will look funny if you can't fit
      any other things
