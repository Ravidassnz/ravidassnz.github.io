        I love problem-solving and looking for solutions that others may not
        have thought about before. This high-level approach is great, but also
        tends to come with a weakness of missing details. This is a big
        limitation in dev work and can see that it could be a frustrating start
        to my journey..

    <p>This course has given me the prompt to revisit my time-management skills I
      had learned at uni. There still is a bit more to do before the bootcamp
      process, but I am starting to feel more comfortable in the space. I have
      worked across a few different organisations, and am comfortable enough
      working with others - pretty excited to be working with others tbh. The
      other challenge would be to reach out to the support around me instead of
      trying to manage this myself - think sprint 2 has highlighted this for me.</p>

      I really appreciate the Monday discord from Jatin, and it does feel more
      like we are working across the teams. It would be ideal to have two
      options per weeks for group calls and if we could possibly have time
      one-on-one to discuss some of these questions during the sprint course. I
      think that is what I have for now, but should have more to add later. Can
      I add that it is great to see that we are not treated like idiots and no
      question is a stupid one - awesome stuff!
