          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

          I had a job a few years ago where I was uncomfortable with the
          direction and how funds were being spent. It was incredibly stressful
          for me and felt I was the only one arguing for change and more
          oversight.

        <p>
          Ultimately, I decided to leave as I could not support what they were
          doing, which was a financial hit for us as a family. It did not take
          long to see the changes in myself and how much better I felt about the
          situation.<br />It was reassuring to know that my own personal values
          and moral compass is stronger than any financial incentive.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This has been a huge part of my identity, and growing up in different
          countries (and regions) has influenced both who I am and how my
          comfortable I am across different cultures. My interest in the social
          and charity space is largely thanks to my upbringing and circle of
          friends that surround me.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am hoping my interest in learning new things and problem solving
          will come in handy here, and my experience working across different
          organisations may help me work collaboratively in team settings.

          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it too late to retrain in a career that others have been in for
          decades? This is where I worry the most and wonder where I wound best
          direct my future focus. There are certainly lots of options and I am
          excited about this part.<br />There is also the issue of doing too
          much at once, which is a challenge in life, but especially in this
          filed of word. I think sprint 2 has really taken me by surprise and
          how much overthinking I have been doing.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </p>

          There was one particular patient that required multiple interventions
          and needed different referral pathways for support. It was frustrating
          when the problem wasn’t solved, or they had a bad experience with
          another health provider. What I found work for them was time –
          listening quietly, reassuring and discussing just their issues.
          Sometimes health professionals get bogged down in problem solving and
          forget that there is a person who it affects as well.<br />&nbsp;
