      <h4>How Human Skills has changed me</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can always learn new tools, be a better person, but you should also accept and appreciate your limitations. Nobody is perfect and don't beat yourself up about it.</li>
          <li>Human skills (values, empathy and self-awareness) improves the dev community you belong to, and improves your own happiness and output.</li>
          <li>My input is valued regardless of how new I am to coding. </li>
          <li>The challenging part was revisiting weaknesses in myself that I know will take time to change or imrpove</li>
          <li>Human skills is such an important part of dev work, where you need to work closely and dynamically across multiple teams. I can see why it is incredibly important throughout ones career and will ongoing</li>
          <li>I don't think it is a waste of time to learn Human Skills, but am quite keen to apply this learning to bootcamp. I feel that this is where the theory will play a massive role in the practical side.</li>
